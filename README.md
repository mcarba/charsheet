# charsheet

Simple semi-automated character sheet for d&d5e.

I couldn't find right combination of flexibility and automation, so I made this sheet for my personal usage.
Autosaves/autoloads to/from browser localstorage.
Can send rolls to the discord via webhooks if webhook url is set.
Not mobile friendly.

You have to manually add attacks/spell info, it's up to you what will it look like ("fireball goes brr")
